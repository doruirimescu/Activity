## Aalto Project Manager Certificate
- During the Project Work course in 2019, I led a team of 7
people and four distinct nationalities towards designing a ship thruster
interface.

- I have successfully scheduled the weekly meetings, performed the WBS,
monitored and managed the project progress (using Gantt charts) and
also lead the team by example, being the hardware design engineer.
